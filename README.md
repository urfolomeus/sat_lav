# Sat Lav

A very basic prototype showing what a potential toilet finder app might look like.

Tested in Chrome and Safari on OS X and iOS. Doesn't work on IE9. Works on IE10+ but some of the styles are off.

If when testing on iOS devices you select Don't Allow when asked if you'd like to use your location, you will no longer be able to use your current location. If you want to reset this so that it does let you use your current location, please do as follows:

1. Go to Settings
2. Select General
3. Scroll down to the bottom and select Reset
4. Scroll down to the bottom and select Reset Location & Privacy
5. Fill in your passcode if prompted to do so
6. Select Reset Settings on the popup that appears after that
7. It may take a second or two to run, so give it time.
